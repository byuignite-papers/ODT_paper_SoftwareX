\section{Motivation and significance}
\label{sec:motivation}

Turbulent flows characterize the vast majority of fluid flows in practical engineering applications, and simulations of turbulent flows provide researchers with valuable insights into complex systems, particularly reacting turbulent flows such as combustion processes. Turbulence is a complex phemonenon that affects the full range of a flow's length and time scales. As a result, resolving the entire flow field by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow, as is done in direct numerical simulations (DNS), requires substantial computational resources. DNS is a powerful research tool, but its high computational cost makes it intractable for simulating most practical engineering flows. In order to achieve numerical solutions to practical flow problems, researchers can use alternative frameworks that model turbulence rather than resolving it directly.

Large-eddy simulations (LES) address the problem of wide-ranging length and time scales by combining  direct resolution of grid-scale quantities, as in DNS, with subgrid modeling of smaller turbulence structures. The more complex the flow, the more modeling is required; for example, a jet flame simulation might require subgrid modeling for the combustion chemistry, radiative heat transfer, or soot chemistry in addition to turbulence structures, all of which form a tightly coupled system in which each model interacts heavily with the others. While subgrid modeling makes LES more computationally affordable than DNS, it can introduce empiricism into simulations, which can lead to inaccurate results. Additionally, unresolved quantities are often parameterized in state space with empirical relationships or assumed distributions that lack universal applicability. LES is a valuable simulation tool, but its approach to turbulence modeling can introduce unwanted empiricism and make errors difficult to isolate and quantify.

The one-dimensional turbulence model (ODT) functionally reverses the LES approach, modeling large-scale turbulent advection and directly resolving small-scale flow structures, simulating the full range of length and time scales in a single dimension. Because large-scale structures are much easier to study and model than small-scale structures, ODT mitigates or sidesteps many of the subgrid modeling issues that complicate LES. Previous studies show that ODT can attain accuracy comparable to DNS at a fraction of the computational cost \cite{Lignell_2015,Abboud_2015}, making it an attractive tool for simulating turbulent flows. Because the model is one-dimensional, it is limited to homogeneous or boundary layer flows such as jets, wakes, and mixing layers; such flows, however, are extremely common in both nature and turbulence research. ODT's computational efficiency and resolution of a full range of scales make it a valuable tool that complements experimental studies and other simulation tools like DNS and LES.

\section{Software description}
\label{sec:description}

\subsection{Model description}
\label{sub:model_description}

The ODT model is described in detail in the literature \cite{Kerstein_1999,Kerstein_2001,Ashurst_2005,Lignell_2018,Lignell_2013}; only a brief explanation will be given here. In ODT, turbulent advection is modeled with stochastic processes called eddy events, which punctuate the solution of unsteady, one-dimensional transport equations for mass, momentum, and enthalpy. The ODT code uses a Lagrangian finite-volume formulation for diffusive advancement that includes adaptive mesh refinement \cite{Lignell_2013}. In this approach, mass remains constant inside each grid cell while cell volumes increase or decrease according to dilation. Because the ODT model is one-dimensional, it is limited to homogeneous or boundary-layer flows, such as jets, wakes, and mixing layers; these types of flows, however, are common in nature and central to turbulence research.

Eddy events occur as a Poisson process in accordance with their eddy rates, where a given eddy event of size $l$ and location $x_0$ has an eddy timescale $t$ and an associated eddy rate $1/t$. Three user-defined ODT parameters control the eddy event process: the eddy rate parameter $C$ scales the rate of occurrence of the eddies; the viscous penalty parameter $Z$ suppresses small eddies; and the large eddy suppression parameter $\beta$ constrains eddies such that they do not reach over the elapsed simulation time. 

Eddy events modify domain variables using triplet maps, as illustrated for a cylindrical domain in Figure \ref{fig:tripletmap}. For a region of eddy size $l$, the domain is copied to create three map images; the three images are then placed back to back with the middle image inverted to maintain continuity, and the composite is reapplied to the domain. This process applies to all transported variables on the domain. Applied properly, the triplet map increases scalar gradients and decreases length scales consistent with the application of turbulent eddies in real flows, conserves all quantities and their statistical moments, and maintains continuity in property profiles. Subsequent eddies in the same region will result in a cascade of scales, and eddy rates depend on eddy size and the local kinetic energy such that they follow turbulent cascade scaling laws.

	\caption{Schematic diagram of a cylindrical triplet map, adapted from \cite{Lignell_2018}. Before the triplet map, the domain contains three grid cells of equal volume, while after the triplet map has been applied, the domain contains nine cells. The nine final cells are labeled according to the cells from which they originated and shaded to indicate that three map images were combined to create the final composite.}

\subsection{Software Architecture}
\label{sub:architecture}

The ODT code is a relatively self-contained C++ package. The system of nonlinear ODEs is solved using CVODE \cite{Hindmarsh_2020} and user input files are processed with YAML \cite{Beder_2008}, both of which are installed locally during the ODT build process. For reacting flow cases, chemical kinetics and transport are handled by Cantera \cite{Goodwin_2018}, which must be previously installed by the user.

%COPIED/PASTED FROM CYLINDRICAL ODT PAPER
%ODT has been applied by a number of researchers to a wide range of flows. These include homogeneous turbulence \cite{Kerstein_1999,Sun_2014}, wakes \cite{Kerstein_2000}, mixing layers \cite{Kerstein_1999,Kerstein_2001,Ashurst_2003,Ashurst_2005}, stratified flows \cite{Wunsch_2001}, Rayleigh-Benard flows \cite{Wunsch_2005}, buoyant wall flows \cite{Dreeben_2000,Shihn_2007}, and channel flows \cite{Schmidt_2009,Schmidt_2003,Lignell_2013}. Schmidt et al. \cite{Schmidt_2013} studied buoyantly-driven cloud-top entrainment with comparisons to water tank experiments. Gonzalez-Juez et al. \cite{Esteban_2013} studied reactive Rayleigh-Taylor mixing. A number of ODT simulations of turbulent jet flames have been performed \cite{Echekki_2001,Hewson_2001,Hewson_2002,Punati_2011,Lignell_2012b,Lignell_2015}. Other combustion applications include wall fires \cite{Monson_2016,Shihn_2004}, buoyant pool fires \cite{Ricks_2010,Hewson_2006,Hewson_2009}, and opposed jet flames \cite{Jozefik_2015}. Several studies used DNS to validate ODT for combustion in temporal planar jets \cite{Punati_2011,Lignell_2012b,Lignell_2015}. ODT has also been applied as a subgrid model for large eddy simulations (LES) \cite{Cao_2008,Schmidt_2003,Schmidt_2010} and in particle dynamics simulations in channel flows \cite{Schmidt_2009}, homogeneous turbulence \cite{Sun_2014}, and jets \cite{Sun_2017,Goshayeshi_2015}.

%TEXT COPIED FROM ABANDONED JOSS DRAFT

%ODT has been applied to a wide range of flows. Early applications focused on homogenous turbulence, wakes, and mixing layers (Kerstein1999,Kerstein2000,Kerstein2001). Later extension to variable-density flows and a spatial downstream coordinate system facilitated its growth and application to more complex flows, including combustion in jet flames (Echekki2001; Hewson2001; Hewson2002; Lignell2012; Punati2011; Abdelsamie2017; Lignell2017; Goshayeshi2015), counterflow flames  (Jozefik2015), wall fires (Monson2016), and sooting flames, (Lignell2015; Hewson2006; Hewson2009; Lignell2015b, Ricks2010), as well as other particle flows (Sun2017; Schmidt2009; Sun2014; Fistler2017).  ODT has also served to complement LES through subgrid modeling studies (Cao2008; Schmidt2003; Schmidt2010) and has been applied to various other flow configurations such as double-diffusive interfaces (GonzalezJuez2011), Rayleigh-Taylor mixing (GonzalezJuez2013), and stratified turbulence (Wunsch2001).  Most recently, the ODT code was extended to include cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (Lignell2018; Klein2018; Klein2019). During this implementation, the ODT code was drastically overhauled, resulting in the SEC package presented here. Further detail on the current ODT model formulation and implementation can be found in the literature (Ashurst2005; Kerstein2001; Lignell2013; Lignell2018).

%Ongoing research involving ODT and SEC spans multiple research groups and subject areas. ODT is currently being used to investigate soot formation and destruction in ethylene jet flames via parametric modeling studies (Hewson2015; Lansinger2015b). The SEC package framework is also being used to develop the hierarchical parcel swapping model (HiPS), which models turbulence with an economical, hierarchical network that represents the fluid as individual parcels capable of switching positions within the tree (Kerstein2013; Kerstein2014). In the future, SEC may also be extended to include the linear eddy model (LEM) (Kerstein1991) and LES approaches.
