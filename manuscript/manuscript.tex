TEXT COPIED FROM CYLINDRICAL ODT PAPER

The one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model was introduced by Kerstein in 1999 \cite{Kerstein_1999}. ODT is computationally efficient because it only resolves flows in a single dimension. Turbulent advection is modeled through stochastic eddy events that are implemented by mapping processes on the domain using triplet maps. Eddy events occur concurrently with the solution of unsteady one-dimensional transport equations for momentum and other scalar quantities. A full range of turbulent length scales is modeled. Eddy event locations, sizes, and occurrence rates are specified dynamically and locally using the momentum fields that evolve with the flow; temperature or scalar fields are also used for buoyant flows. Because the model is one-dimensional, it is limited to homogeneous or boundary layer flows such as jets, wakes, mixing layers, and channel flows. These flows, however, are extremely common in turbulence research, and ODT's computational efficiency and resolution of a full range of scales make it a valuable tool that complements experimental and other simulation methods such as direct numerical simulation (DNS). Unlike ODT, DNS resolves all flow structures in three dimensions, but is computationally expensive. ODT is currently formulated for planar simulations, and the model can be run in temporal or spatial modes. In the temporal mode, the unsteady evolution equations evolve on a one-dimensional domain. In the spatial mode, the flow is assumed steady state (though punctuated with eddy events), and one-dimensional ODT line profiles evolve along a streamwise coordinate that replaces the time coordinate, as is done in steady boundary layer flows.

All of these simulated flows used the planar formulation of ODT, even when comparing to experiments of round jets. This comparison is reasonable for jets because the Reynolds number is axially invariant in both constant-property spatial round jets and constant-property temporal planar jets \cite{Sun_2017}. To compare temporal ODT simulations to spatial experimental simulations, however, time on the ODT line must be converted to the experimental axial spatial location. This is normally done using a mean line velocity (such as the ratio of the integrated momentum flux to the integrated mass flux) \cite{Sun_2017}, but this implies that all fluid parcels on the line have the same axial location time history. This assumption is not ideal for phenomena that are sensitive to time history, such as soot formation, flame extinction and reignition processes, and particle-turbulence interactions. 

These limitations in applying the planar ODT formulation to cylindrical flows motivate the work presented here. In this paper, we extend the ODT model from the planar formulation to include cylindrical and spherical formulations. There have been some previous efforts to implement cylindrical and spherical ODT formulations. Krishnamoorthy \cite{Niveditha_thesis} implemented a cylindrical ODT formulation and applied the model in pipe and jet configurations. Lackmann et al. \cite{Lackmann_2017} implemented a spherical formulation of the linear eddy model (LEM) for engine applications. Here, we give a detailed description of cylindrical and spherical formulations of ODT. While the spherical formulation is included for completeness, we focus on the cylindrical formulation because it is most directly applicable to current and previous ODT research efforts. We defer to the literature for much of the existing ODT model formulation, e.g., \cite{Lignell_2013,Ashurst_2005,Kerstein_2001}, and focus on the new cylindrical and spherical geometries. For completeness, however, we include summary information of the ODT model formulation. We present results of the cylindrical formulation applied to pipe flow, a round nonreacting spatial jet, and a round jet flame. A more detailed study of round pipe flow than is possible in this paper is presented by Medina et al. \cite{Medina_2017}.

TEXT COPIED FROM ABANDONED JOSS DRAFT

The Stochastic Eddy Cascade (SEC) package is a set of models and tools used to simulate turbulent flow systems in which turbulence is modeled by stochastic processes that map so-called "eddy events" onto the domain. Most notably, SEC includes the most current implementation of the one-dimensional turbulence model (ODT), which has been successfully used to simulate turbulent reacting and nonreacting flows with high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. In addition to ODT, SEC also offers a flamelet model for combustion systems, which is useful for model validation and testing. 

Turbulent flows characterize the vast majority of fluid flows in practical engineering applications, and simulations of turbulent flows provide researchers with valuable insights into complex systems, particularly reacting turbulent flows such as combustion processes \cite{Pope2000}. Turbulence is a complex phemonenon that occurs over the full range of the flow's length and time scales. As a result, resolving the entire flow field by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow, as is done in direct numerical simulations (DNS), requires intense computational resources. DNS is a powerful research tool, but its high computational cost makes this approach intractable for most practical engineering flows. In order to achieve solutions to practical flow problems, turbulence is most often modeled. For example, large-eddy simulation (LES) approaches directly resolve large-scale flow structures but model small-scale motion, which often results in accurate, computationally efficient simulation data. Unfortunately, LES approaches can introduce empiricism into flow simulations, and errors can be difficult to isolate and quantify. The one-dimensional turbulence model (ODT) functionally reverses the LES approach, modeling large-scale turbulent advection (which is relatively well-understood) and directly resolving small-scale flow structures. In previous studies, ODT has been shown capable of attaining accuracy comparable to DNS at a fraction of the computational cost \cite{Lignell2015,Abboud2015}, making it an attractive model for simulating turbulent flows, particularly in combustion systems. 

ODT has been applied to a wide range of flows. Early applications focused on homogenous turbulence, wakes, and mixing layers (Kerstein1999,Kerstein2000,Kerstein2001). Later extension to variable-density flows and a spatial downstream coordinate system facilitated its growth and application to more complex flows, including combustion in jet flames (Echekki2001; Hewson2001; Hewson2002; Lignell2012; Punati2011; Abdelsamie2017; Lignell2017; Goshayeshi2015), counterflow flames  (Jozefik2015), wall fires (Monson2016), and sooting flames, (Lignell2015; Hewson2006; Hewson2009; Lignell2015b, Ricks2010), as well as other particle flows (Sun2017; Schmidt2009; Sun2014; Fistler2017).  ODT has also served to complement LES through subgrid modeling studies (Cao2008; Schmidt2003; Schmidt2010) and has been applied to various other flow configurations such as double-diffusive interfaces (GonzalezJuez2011), Rayleigh-Taylor mixing (GonzalezJuez2013), and stratified turbulence (Wunsch2001).  Most recently, the ODT code was extended to include cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (Lignell2018; Klein2018; Klein2019). During this implementation, the ODT code was drastically overhauled, resulting in the SEC package presented here. Further detail on the current ODT model formulation and implementation can be found in the literature (Ashurst2005; Kerstein2001; Lignell2013; Lignell2018).

Ongoing research involving ODT and SEC spans multiple research groups and subject areas. ODT is currently being used to investigate soot formation and destruction in ethylene jet flames via parametric modeling studies (Hewson2015; Lansinger2015b). The SEC package framework is also being used to develop the hierarchical parcel swapping model (HiPS), which models turbulence with an economical, hierarchical network that represents the fluid as individual parcels capable of switching positions within the tree (Kerstein2013; Kerstein2014). In the future, SEC may also be extended to include the linear eddy model (LEM) (Kerstein1991) and LES approaches.

\section{Software description}
\label{sec:description}

\subsection{Model description}
\label{sub:model_description}

Describe how ODT works here. Turbulent advection via eddy events implemented by triplet maps. Planar vs. cylindrical configurations. Eddy events happen concurrently with solution of transport equations.  Evolution of transport equations in only one dimension. Limited to one-dimensional flows: jets, wakes, mixing layers. This is fine though because those are common in nature and important to research. 

TEXT COPIED FROM UNFINISHED CONFERENCE PAPER

This study employs the most current version of the ODT code as in Lignell et. al. \cite{Lignell_2018}, and the ODT model in general is described in detail in the literature \cite{Lignell_2018,Lignell_2013,Kerstein_1999,Kerstein_2001,Ashurst_2005}. 
The ODT code uses a Lagrangian finite-volume formulation for diffusive advancement, including adaptive mesh refinement \cite{Lignell_2013}. In this approach, combustion dilation causes grid cells to increase or decrease in volume while mass remains constant within each cell. 
Turbulent advection is modeled with stochastic processes called "eddy events" that map functions on the domain via triplet maps. These eddy events occur concurrently with the solution of unsteady one-dimensional transport equations for mass, momentum, and enthalpy. In sooting flame cases, we also transport species mass fractions and soot particle size distribution properties. Because the ODT model is one-dimensional, it is limited to homogeneous or boundary-layer flows, such as jets, wakes, and mixing layers; these types of flows, however, are common in nature and central to turbulence research.

 and whose sizes are drawn randomly from a sample distribution. A given eddy of size $l$ and location $x_0$ has an eddy timescale $t$ and an associated eddy rate $1=t$. Eddies occur as a Poisson process in accordance with their given rates. Three ODT parameters control the eddy event process: the eddy rate parameter $C$ scales the rate of occurrence of the eddies; the viscous penalty parameter $Z$ suppresses small eddies; and the large eddy suppression parameter $\beta$ constrains eddies such that they do not reach over the elapsed simulation time.

\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

Questions to answer in this section (from SoftwareX template)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How can new research questions be pursued with this software?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item possibility of parametric studies (much harder with DNS/LES/RANS)
			\item study of late-flame soot and radiation interactions, soot emissions as smoke

	\item How does the software improve pursuit of existing research questions?
		\begin{itemize}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item BYU group
			\item JCH at Sandia

		\begin{itemize}
			\item No commercial use (I think). 
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

COPIED/PASTED FROM CYLINDRICAL ODT PAPER
ODT has been applied by a number of researchers to a wide range of flows. These include homogeneous turbulence \cite{Kerstein_1999,Sun_2014}, wakes \cite{Kerstein_2000}, mixing layers \cite{Kerstein_1999,Kerstein_2001,Ashurst_2003,Ashurst_2005}, stratified flows \cite{Wunsch_2001}, Rayleigh-Benard flows \cite{Wunsch_2005}, buoyant wall flows \cite{Dreeben_2000,Shihn_2007}, and channel flows \cite{Schmidt_2009,Schmidt_2003,Lignell_2013}. Schmidt et al. \cite{Schmidt_2013} studied buoyantly-driven cloud-top entrainment with comparisons to water tank experiments. Gonzalez-Juez et al. \cite{Esteban_2013} studied reactive Rayleigh-Taylor mixing. A number of ODT simulations of turbulent jet flames have been performed \cite{Echekki_2001,Hewson_2001,Hewson_2002,Punati_2011,Lignell_2012b,Lignell_2015}. Other combustion applications include wall fires \cite{Monson_2016,Shihn_2004}, buoyant pool fires \cite{Ricks_2010,Hewson_2006,Hewson_2009}, and opposed jet flames \cite{Jozefik_2015}. Several studies used DNS to validate ODT for combustion in temporal planar jets \cite{Punati_2011,Lignell_2012b,Lignell_2015}. ODT has also been applied as a subgrid model for large eddy simulations (LES) \cite{Cao_2008,Schmidt_2003,Schmidt_2010} and in particle dynamics simulations in channel flows \cite{Schmidt_2009}, homogeneous turbulence \cite{Sun_2014}, and jets \cite{Sun_2017,Goshayeshi_2015}.
